# text-analysis

This repository matches a blog at https://confessionsofadatascientist.com/text-analysis-with-r-repro-report.html and is meant for educational purposes. The datasets have been altered to minimize any risk but do reflect actual comments made. The results you get will be different than those from the blog due to the alteration. Nonetheless, they should provide some usefulness to test out the code.

If you have any questions or comments -- do not hesitate to contact via the information provided on the website mentioned above.
